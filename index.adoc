== Introduction
This is the introduction to the **MicronautPi4J Documentation**!

== Adding to a project

== Using the library

=== General Info

== Types of Components

=== DigitalInput
To define in application.yaml add digital-input as a field under pi4j, then add each component under digital-input
Each component will need

* name: Name of the component
* address: GPIO pin associated with component
* debounce:
* pull: Either PULL_UP or PULL_DOWN depending on component
* provider: pigpio-digital-input

==== Components
===== Push Button

include::inputComponents/pushbutton.adoc[]

===== Slide Switch
include::inputComponents/slideSwitch.adoc[]

===== Rotary Encoder

include::inputComponents/rotaryEncoder.adoc[]

=== DigitalOutput
To define in application.yaml add digital-output as a field under pi4j, then add each component under digital-input
Each component will need

* name: Name of the component
* address: GPIO pin associated with component
* initial: Initial value, either LOW or HIGH
* shutdown: State to take when program successfully shuts down properly, either LOW or HIGH
* provider: pigpio-digital-output

==== Components
===== LED

include::outputComponents/led.adoc[]

=== PWM
To define in application.yaml add digital-input as a field under pi4j, then add each component under digital-input
Each component will need

* name: Name of the component
* address: GPIO pin associated with component
* pwmType: Either SOFTWARE or HARDWARE based upon which type of PWM you wish to use
* provider: pigpio-pwm

==== Components
===== RGB LED
