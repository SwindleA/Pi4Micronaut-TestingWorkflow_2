=== Getting Started With Pi4Micronaut!

==== Prerequisites
. Before beginning the setup, ensure that your Raspberry Pi and your system are both connected to the same network

==== Build the Jar file
. Open your terminal of choice
. Navigate to the file directory containing the Pi4Micronaut library
. Enter the following command into the terminal to build the jar file: "./gradlew"
. The necessary components jar file can be found under "../Pi4Micronaut/components/build/libs/components-0.1-all.jar"

==== Install the Raspberry Pi Imager
. To upload the Jar file onto your Raspberry Pi, you need to install the Raspberry Pi Imager
. Go to the following link and download the correct version for your system: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

==== Set up Raspberry Pi OS
. Now, start up the Raspberry Pi Imager.
. Grab an SD card and get it hooked up to your computer.
. In the Imager app, click "*CHOOSE DEVICE*" and select your Pi device.
. Next, click "*CHOOSE OS*" -> "*Raspberry Pi OS (other)*" -> "*Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) Lite*"
. For storage, choose the SD card and click Next.
. Before clicking "*NEXT*," Press *Ctrl+Shift+X* to enter the Advanced Settings
. Under the GENERAL tab:
.. Set your hostname to whatever you choose
.. Create username and password for your Raspberry Pi
.. Check "Configure wireless LAN" and set your password to your networks password

+
. Click save and write to the SD card


==== Connecting to Raspberry Pi
. Get your Raspberry Pi plugged into a power source.
. Get the IP address of your Pi and SSH into it
.. Follow the instructions outlined in this article: https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-s/en/latest/get_started_with_raspberry_pi.html#get-the-ip-address


==== Installing Java
. First, make sure your Raspberry Pi's package list is up-to-date by running the following commands in your Pi's terminal:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
----
. Next, install Java onto your Pi by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
----
To verify installation, run
+
[source, bash]
----
java --version
----

==== Copy Over Jar File
. Open a terminal and head to the directory containing the components jar file: "../Pi4Micronaut/components/build/libs/components-0.1-all.jar"
. Enter the following command: "scp components-0.1-all.jar {username}"@{raspberry_pi_id}:~"
.. Following our configuration from earlier, this would look like "scp components-0.1-all.jar test@raspberrypi-test:~"

==== Almost Done!
. To test if you've set up Pi4Micronaut correctly on your raspberry pi, we have some sample commands for you run.
. Open a new Windows Powershell and ssh into your raspberry pi.
. Enter the following command to test the turn on funcion for an LED light: "curl http://localhost:8080/led/LedOn"
. If this command works, congratulations! You have successfully used our Pi4Micronaut library!

==== Enabling Different Communication Protocols
. If you need to enable different communcation protocols, such as I2C, SPI, etc., do the following:
